We started at the end of January with the second series of six webinars &lt;a href=&quot;https://galaxyproject.eu/posts/2021/02/25/2nd-elixir-webinar-series-covid/&quot;&gt;‘Open Data Infrastructures to tackle COVID-19 pandemic’&lt;/a&gt; and continued with four more webinars on &lt;a href=&quot;https://elixir-europe.org/events/galaxy-elixir-webinars-series-advanced-features&quot;&gt;‘Galaxy advanced features’&lt;/a&gt; chaired by Hans-Rudolf Hotz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 4 weeks, we got an excellent &lt;strong&gt;overview of recent features in Galaxy that may have remained unknown to many users, due to the rapid developments in this very large and very active community&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first webinar, Marius van den Beek and Aysam Guerler explained all sort of new features related to workflows: parameters, invocations, reports…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;415&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7atWvOoMQwE&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second session was run by Wolfgang Maier and Anton Nekrutenko. They guided us through the process of importing massive data from SRA/ENA and processing it making use of collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;415&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7DN8hbI87PE&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the third webinar, Daniel Blankenberg, Bérénice Batut and Helena Rasche prepared a showcase of the bridge between Jupyter notebooks, RStudio and Galaxy workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;415&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/eEpuA5oltrA&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the fourth webinar, led by Jennifer Hillman-Jackson and Anika Erxleben, addressed all the user preference options, explored all the possibilities for data sharing in project collaborations, and error debugging whenever an issue running a tool arises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;415&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IUCgUHCixxc&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strong attendance and YouTube access to these webinars show the interest they generated in the Galaxy community. We would like to thank all the speakers for this wonderful series, and to the ELIXIR Hub technical team for the support. We hope you can enjoy the recordings and we will be happy to organize another such webinar series at a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;

We never used TiaaS before these trainings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 16 November to 16 December 2020, the Bioinformatics Course for Biomedical Research was taught to 25 students. This course provides students with the knowledge to understand common workflows in omics data analysis and to be familiar with common bioinformatics tools. Some of the lessons taught include an introduction to the Galaxy Platform, Quality control of NGS data, RNAseq and Variant data analysis. Some of the lessons were focused on the tutorials found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/&quot;&gt;Galaxy Training Network (GTN)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 23 to 25 February 2021, Bioinformatics lessons within the study plan of the Master in Translational Biomedical Research were taught to more than 50 students. This master is an official programme that gives access to doctoral studies and it has been designed in order to create excellent translational researchers able to contribute to the transformation of knowledge from basic research into clinical applications that provide a benefit to the patient’s health. Some of the lessons taught include an introduction to the Galaxy Platform, RNAseq and Variant data analysis, focused again in the tutorials found in the GTN among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After using Training Infrastructure as a Service resources in both trainings, we can say that the effect on the dynamics and performance for the sessions where the resources were used was extremely positive. Compared to previous editions, TiaaS allowed us to achieve more, faster and in a more convenient way (special mention here for the queue monitoring page, super useful for the trainers), and the improvement on the overall satisfaction for both trainers and students was clear regarding Galaxy usage. Therefore, the resources made a significant contribution to conduct the trainings in a more fluid and effective way. In addition, the process for requesting the resources was straightforward, the resources allocated were accurate for our needs,  and the people from UseGalaxy.eu were always quick and efficient at providing instructions, follow-up and assistance when needed (many thanks in particular to Beatriz Serrano-Solano).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, highly recommended. Thanks for making this service available!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dr. Ricardo Gonzalo Sanz</name></author><category term="training" /><category term="TIaaS" /><summary type="html">Recently, staff from the Statistics and Bioinformatics Unit from Vall d’Hebron Institute of Research (VHIR) were involved in two trainings where we used TIaaS resources.

it is also possible to import a
workflow directly into Galaxy and run it. This is using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ga4gh.org/&quot;&gt;GH4GH&lt;/a&gt; API &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ga4gh/tool-registry-service-schemas&quot;&gt;TRS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have created a video showcasing the process for a COVID-19 data analysis workflow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Search in the Workflow Hub and retrieve a Galaxy workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Import it easily into Galaxy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get remote COVID-19 data into your Galaxy history.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run the imported workflow on the remote data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how it works in practice in the following video:&lt;/p&gt;

The OM-02 course is an elective module for Master students in their first semester tailored to help them identify a specialisation to pursue subsequent research internships and their thesis work. All students came from different backgrounds and training in their undergraduate studies, and have not had prior exposure to bioinformatics analyses or coding. I started by giving an introduction to the Galaxy platform for -omics analysis and focussed specifically on the following tutorials found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://training.galaxyproject.org/&quot;&gt;https://training.galaxyproject.org/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From peaks to genes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quality Control&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mapping&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reference-based RNA-Seq data analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course was previously conducted in a computer lab at the Faculty of Biology and required at least two persons (including the main lecturer and teaching assistant) to rove and assist a class of up to 15 per day as students worked through the assigned tutorials individually. Due to the pandemic, this year’s practical course took place over Zoom. Taking advantage of the TIaaS infrastructure for which we were allocated four servers, each with 32 cores and 240 GB of RAM, we were able to smoothly work through the tutorials remotely. The possibility to monitor the progress of each job was a welcome feature as this allowed me to keep up with the students’ progress despite the remote format. In addition, I had recruited four PhD student tutors familiar with Galaxy to guide 3-4 students in breakout rooms during the hands-on sessions. The tutors also used their own research data to demonstrate the practical applications of the course content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat Zoom fatigue, I shortened all lectures by half and held open book quizzes and recap sessions to promote self-learning and understanding of the training material. The interactive and relaxed atmosphere created by inclusive pedagogical methods ensured that all students participated both verbally and in writing to reinforce their key learning points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, many thanks to the Galaxy TIaaS and the GTN material, without which this course would not have been possible!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dr. Tuan Leng Tay</name></author><category term="training" /><category term="TIaaS" /><summary type="html">From 22 to 26 February 2021, I ran a full-time bioinformatics workshop during the practical “Block Week” for 23 Master of Biology students at the University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau.
