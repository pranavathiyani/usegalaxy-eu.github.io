DESCRIPTION:This course is aimed at researchers with little-to-no experience in big data analysis who are generating, planning on generating, or working with single-cell RNA sequencing data.\n\nAfter this course you should be able to:\n\n<ul>  <li>Explain the steps in the scRNA-seq pipeline</li>  <li>Repeat the course analysis of scRNA-seq data from extraction to trajectories</li>  <li>Recognise decision-making steps along the analysis pipeline and justify your decisions, from experimental design to final visualisation</li></ul>The <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/single-cell-rna-seq-analysis-using-galaxy-0/#vf-tabs__section--tab3">application</a> is open until November 27th.\n\n
